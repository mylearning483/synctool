First, let's identify the relevant rules in the given text:

###Rule Country of Origin Rule: there should be no prohibition of goods originating wholly or in part from or processed in boycotted countries.
###Rule Authorized Ports Rule: there must be no requirement that the shipment vessel be authorized to enter the countries or ports of boycotting countries. There must also be no requirement that the shipment companies operate with laws of boycotting countries regarding vessel, flags, port, shipment, and transshipment.
###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule: there must be no prohibition of shipment vessels from entering or going through countries and ports of boycotted countries.
Now let's review the text and see if there are any violations of these rules:

In the given text, it mentions that transportation should be effected by companies operating in accordance with Bangladesh laws and regulations regarding vessel, flags, port, shipment, and transshipment. This violates the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule because it requires the shipment companies to operate in accordance with the laws and regulations of Bangladesh, which is one of the boycotting countries.

Therefore, the violated rule is the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule.

Additionally, there is no mention of any shipment vessel or authorization of entry in the text. Hence, the text does not violate the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule or the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule.

Therefore, the violated rule is the ###Rule Country of Origin Rule.

First, let's identify the relevant rules in the given text:

###Rule Authorized Ports Rule: there must be no requirement that the shipment vessel be authorized to enter the countries or ports of boycotting countries.
###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule: there must be no prohibition of shipment vessels from entering or going through countries and ports of boycotted countries.
Now let's review the text and see if there are any violations of these rules:

In the given text, we see the mention of Arab ports. The text states that the vessel should not be prohibited from entering Arab ports for any reason.

This violates the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule because it specifically mentions the prohibition of vessels from entering Arab ports. Although Arab countries are not explicitly mentioned in the list of boycotted countries, the rule states that there should be no prohibition of shipment vessels from going through countries and ports of boycotted countries. Therefore, mentioning a prohibition in relation to Arab ports raises a potential violation of this rule.

Additionally, there is no mention of Israel, which is the boycotted country, in the text. Hence, the text does not violate the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule.

Therefore, the violated rule is the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule.

Violated Rule: No Prohibition of Ports Rule

Therefore, the violated rule is the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule.
