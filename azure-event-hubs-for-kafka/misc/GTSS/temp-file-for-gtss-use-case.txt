2. ### Rule Country of Origin Rule: there should be no prohibition of goods originating wholly or in part from or processed in boycotted countries.
   - This rule is not violated as there is no mention of boycotted countries or any prohibition related to them.

3. ### Rule Authorized Ports Rule: there must be no requirement that the shipment vessel be authorized to enter the countries or ports of boycotting countries. There must also be no requirement that the shipment company operate in compliance with the laws of boycotting countries regarding vessel, flags, port, shipment, and transshipment.

is there no mention of compliance with laws of boycotting countries?

Chat gpt:
Apologies for the oversight. Upon re-evaluating the text, it does mention compliance with laws, specifically "SHIPMENT ACCORDING TO BANGLADESHI LAWS" in point 3. 

Therefore, the violation is as follows:

- Rule Authorized Ports Rule: there must be no requirement that the shipment company operate in compliance with the laws of boycotting countries regarding vessel, flags, port, shipment, and transshipment.

I apologize for the confusion caused by my previous response.

Now let's review the text and see if there are any violations of these rules:

There is no explicit prohibition mentioned for goods originating from or processed in boycotted countries.

This could potentially imply compliance with the laws of boycotting countries regarding vessel, flags, port, shipment, and transshipment.

Therefore, the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule may have been violated.

Now let's review the text and see if there are any violations of these rules:

In the given text, it states that goods originating from or shipped through any Iranian or Israeli airport/seaport are strictly prohibited under this LC (Letter of Credit).

In the given text, it states that "GOODS OF ISRAELI Origin" are prohibited. This directly violates the ###Rule Country of Origin Rule because it prohibits goods originating from the boycotted country, which is Israel.

Additionally, there is no mention of any shipment vessel or authorization of entry in the text. Hence, the text does not violate the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule or the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule.

###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule: there must be no prohibition of shipment vessels from entering or going through countries and ports of boycotted countries.
Now let's review the text and see if there are any violations of these rules:

In the given text, we see the mention of Arab ports. The text states that the vessel should not be prohibited from entering Arab ports for any reason.

This violates the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule because it specifically mentions the prohibition of vessels from entering Arab ports. Although Arab countries are not explicitly mentioned in the list of boycotted countries, the rule states that there should be no prohibition of shipment vessels from going through countries and ports of boycotted countries. Therefore, mentioning a prohibition in relation to Arab ports raises a potential violation of this rule.

Additionally, there is no mention of Israel, which is the boycotted country, in the text. Hence, the text does not violate the ###Rule Authorized Ports Rule.

Therefore, the violated rule is the ###Rule No Prohibition of Ports Rule.
