# Send and Receive Messages in Node using Event Hubs for Apache Kafka Ecosystems

This quickstart will show how to create and connect to an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint using an example producer and consumer written in Node. Azure Event Hubs for Apache Kafka Ecosystems supports [Apache Kafka version 1.0](https://kafka.apache.org/10/documentation.html) and later.

This sample uses the [node-rdkafka](https://github.com/Blizzard/node-rdkafka) library. For instructions on how to configure for Windows, please visit the node-rdkafka project and follow their instructions before continuing with the sample. This sample is untested on Windows, but it has been tested on the [Linux Subsystem on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.

In addition:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
-   [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
    -   On Mac OS, you can run `brew install openssl`
    -   On Ubuntu, `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
-   [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/downloads)
    -   On Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install git` to install Git.

## Create an Event Hubs namespace

An Event Hub's namespace is required to send or receive from any Event Hubs service. See [Create Kafka Enabled Event Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-create-kafka-enabled) for instructions on getting an Event Hubs Kafka endpoint. Make sure to copy the Event Hubs connection string for later use.

Additionally, topics in Kafka map to Event Hub instances, so create an Event Hub instance called "test" that our samples can send and receive messages from.  **If the Event Hub is not created, message delivery will not complete.**

### FQDN

For these samples, you will need the connection string from the portal as well as the FQDN that points to your Event Hub namespace. **The FQDN can be found within your connection string as follows**:

`Endpoint=sb://`**`mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net`**`/;SharedAccessKeyName=XXXXXX;SharedAccessKey=XXXXXX`

If your Event Hubs namespace is deployed on a non-Public cloud, your domain name may differ (e.g. \*.servicebus.chinacloudapi.cn, \*.servicebus.usgovcloudapi.net, or \*.servicebus.cloudapi.de).

## Clone the example project

Now that you have a Kafka-enabled Event Hubs connection string, clone the Azure Event Hubs for Kafka repository and navigate to the `quickstart/node` subfolder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka.git
cd azure-event-hubs-for-kafka/quickstart/node
```

## Configuration

Configure the Kafka Producer/Consumer types with the fully qualified domain name and port of the Kafka head of your Event Hub and its connection string. For the consumer, you will also need the consumer group for that 'topic' (event hub); the default in Azure Event Hubs is `$Default`.

```javascript
var producer = new Kafka.Producer({
  //'debug' : 'all',
  'metadata.broker.list': 'mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net:9093', //REPLACEâ€‹
  'dr_cb': true,  //delivery report callback
  'security.protocol': 'SASL_SSL',
  'sasl.mechanisms': 'PLAIN',
  'sasl.username': '$ConnectionString', //do not replace $ConnectionString
  'sasl.password': 'Endpoint=sb://mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=XXXXXX;SharedAccessKey=XXXXXX' //REPLACE
});

```

This sample uses the [`node-rdkafka` module](https://github.com/Blizzard/node-rdkafka); to install the node module to your project, run this command:

Linux:
```bash
npm install node-rdkafka
```

Mac OS:
``` bash
CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib npm install node-rdkafka
```

## Producer

The producer sample demonstrates how to send messages to the Event Hubs service using the Kafka head.

You can run the sample via:

```bash
$ node producer.js
```

The producer will now begin sending events to the Kafka enabled Event Hub on topic `test`. If you would like to change the topic, change the topic variable in `producer.js`.

## Consumer

The consumer sample demonstrates how to receive messages from the Event Hubs service using the Kafka head.

You can run the sample via:

```bash
$ node consumer.js
```

The consumer will now begin receiving events from the Kafka enabled Event Hub on topic `test`. If you would like to change the topic, change the topic variable in `consumer.js`. If the topic has not already been created in the Kafka configuration, no messages will be sent/received.
